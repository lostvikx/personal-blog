            <div class="content"><p>Body cameras are devices used by the police to record audio and video of their interactions with people, that may be potential criminals. I have been infatuated by these footages that can be found on YouTube. These recordings are made to maintain the integrety of the events that an officer experiences during various encounters.</p>
<p>These recordings serve two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tracking events and evidences that may be forgotten or missed.</li>
<li>Keeping officiers from abusing their power.</li>
</ol>
<p>On YouTube these videos regularly go viral and I believe that there are a lot of things that can be learned. I have found myself watching these videos to the point of addiction. They are just so fascinating and novel to my brain, that it is not able to handle the sheer joy and the unpredictable nature of these videos.</p>
<h2>Realistic Action-Thriller</h2>
<p><img src="/personal-blog/assets/imgs/public_shootout.webp" alt="An officer trying to locate a mass-shooter."></p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that these videos showcase real-life action sequences that feel exhilarating. From the nervousness of not knowing that what might go down to satisifcation that justice was served to the victims and their loved ones.</p>
<p>And what makes these encounters even more alive is the Point Of View (POV) camera angle. They help us navigate the criminal case from the perspective of the officer. I don't know why films refuse to use such a cinematic angle where we literally see through the &quot;eyes&quot; of our protagonist.</p>
<p>I also love to see the various hi-tech gadgets being deployed to aid the officer in action. From their taser guns to remote controlled drones, these never seem to bore me. The chase missions are real and dangerous, filled with uncertainty and excitement. The dash cameras installed in police vehicles deliver a sense of speed to the chases. I believe this is what the movies try to capture, but nothing beats the real thing.</p>
<h2>Criminal Psychology</h2>
<p>Why does a person commit crime? To seek revenge, to eliminate a threat, or just for the fun of it. One can argue that most crimes that are committed are mistakes, which can range from misdemenor to felony. Some criminals regret the actions that they took, while others show no mercy.</p>
<p>Understanding how a criminal thinks can lead us to answers for the reasoning behind the act. Why was the act committed, could it have been prevented, and what can we do to ensure that this kind of situation can be avoided in the future. Was there a purpose behind the crime, nothing in life is meaningless. Citizens in a country must feel safe or else there will be chaos and crime thrives in chaotic environment. The main mission of an officer is to keep their locality safe.</p>
<h2>De-Escalating the Situation</h2>
<p>A thing that I really admire when watching these bodycam videos is the level of calmness shown by the cops. I truely believe that these are well meaning humans who just want to keep their neighborhoods safe. Be it a tense stand-offs or a tantrum throwing young adults the officers remain composed.</p>
<p>I hope to instill the ability to remain unfazed under pressure. I believe it to be a skill that can be learned through practice and over time. And the best way to learn this skill would require me to put myself in uncomfortable situations where it is easy to explode than to remain tranquil.</p>
